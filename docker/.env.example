# Network Optimizer Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your values

# ===== Network Binding =====
# BIND_LOCALHOST_ONLY: Controls which network interfaces the app listens on
#   - false (default): Binds to 0.0.0.0:8042 (accessible from network)
#   - true: Binds to 127.0.0.1:8042 (localhost only, use with reverse proxy on same host)
# BIND_LOCALHOST_ONLY=false

# ===== Timezone Configuration =====
# Common US timezones:
#   America/New_York (Eastern), America/Chicago (Central),
#   America/Denver (Mountain), America/Los_Angeles (Pacific)
# Other examples:
#   Europe/London, Europe/Paris, Asia/Tokyo, Australia/Sydney
TZ=America/New_York

# ===== Application Password =====
# Password precedence: Database (Settings UI) > APP_PASSWORD env var > Auto-generated
#
# On first run, an auto-generated password is shown in the logs.
# You can then set a permanent password in Settings > Admin Password (recommended).
# APP_PASSWORD is a fallback - useful for Docker deployments where you want
# to set the password before the first login.
# APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# ===== Host Identity & Canonical URL Enforcement =====
# These settings identify the server for speed testing and optionally enforce a canonical URL.
# Redirects (302) only occur when HOST_NAME or REVERSE_PROXIED_HOST_NAME is set.
# HOST_IP alone does NOT trigger redirects (allows access via any hostname).

# HOST_IP: Server's IP address
#   - Used for: Speed test path analysis, CORS, OpenSpeedTest URL in UI
#   - Required for: Path analysis when server IP can't be auto-detected (bridge networking)
#   - Note: Does NOT enforce redirects (users can still access via hostname)
# HOST_IP=192.168.1.100

# HOST_NAME: Server's hostname (recommended for better UX)
#   - Used for: Canonical URL enforcement, user-facing URLs, OpenSpeedTest link in UI
#   - Requires: DNS resolution by clients (can be local DNS via router/Pi-hole)
#   - Examples: nas, server.local, optimizer.home.arpa
# HOST_NAME=nas

# REVERSE_PROXIED_HOST_NAME: Hostname when behind a reverse proxy
#   - Used for: Canonical URL (https, no port), API URL for OpenSpeedTest result reporting
#   - Set to: The hostname your reverse proxy serves (internal or public)
#   - Note: OpenSpeedTest container is still accessed via HOST_NAME/HOST_IP:3005
# REVERSE_PROXIED_HOST_NAME=optimizer.example.com

# ===== Client Speed Testing =====
# Browser-based: Speed Test runs on port 3005 (configurable), results auto-reported if HOST_IP/HOST_NAME set
#   To disable: comment out the network-optimizer-speedtest service in docker-compose.yml
# CLI-based: Enable iperf3 server mode for testing from devices with iperf3 installed

# Enable iperf3 server (listens on port 5201)
# IPERF3_SERVER_ENABLED=true

# OpenSpeedTest external port (default 3005)
#   - Used for: Docker port mapping, UI display, CORS, and host enforcement redirects
#   - Change if: Port 3005 conflicts with another service
# OPENSPEEDTEST_PORT=3005

# OpenSpeedTest hostname (defaults to HOST_NAME)
#   - Set if speedtest is accessed via a different hostname than the main app
#   - Example: speedtest.example.com when main app is at optimizer.example.com
# OPENSPEEDTEST_HOST=speedtest.example.com

# OpenSpeedTest HTTPS mode
#   Controls how the speed test handles HTTPS when behind a TLS-terminating proxy.
#
#   Values:
#     false (default) - HTTP only, no TLS proxy. Speed test accessed directly.
#     mobile          - HTTP for desktop (max throughput), HTTPS for mobile (geolocation).
#                       Mobile browsers are automatically redirected to HTTPS by the speed
#                       test JS. Desktop browsers stay on HTTP - no TLS overhead at 10 GbE.
#                       CORS includes both HTTP and HTTPS origins.
#     true            - All traffic through HTTPS. UI links to https://.
#
#   "mobile" is recommended when you have a TLS proxy (Traefik, Caddy, etc.) and want
#   geolocation for mobile walk testing without sacrificing desktop throughput.
#
# OPENSPEEDTEST_HTTPS=mobile
#
# HTTPS port for the speed test proxy (default 443)
#   - Used for: CORS origin matching, mobile redirect URL, and UI link construction
#   - Change if: Your TLS proxy listens on a non-standard port (e.g., 8443)
# OPENSPEEDTEST_HTTPS_PORT=443
#
# IMPORTANT: Speedtest reverse proxies MUST force HTTP/1.1 for accurate results.
# HTTP/2+ multiplexing inflates speeds. However, HTTP/1.1 will BREAK the main
# Network Optimizer app (Blazor requires HTTP/2+ for WebSockets).
#
# If you use a TLS proxy, you need TWO separate hostnames:
#   - speedtest.example.com → HTTP/1.1 → localhost:3005 (speedtest)
#   - optimizer.example.com → HTTP/2+  → localhost:8042 (main app)
#
# Your proxy must NOT redirect HTTP→HTTPS for the speedtest hostname, and must NOT
# set HSTS headers. Desktop browsers need to access HTTP for zero TLS overhead.
# See NetworkOptimizer-Proxy for ready-made Traefik configs that handle this.
#
# Geolocation lets you capture where on a property a test was run - useful for
# identifying Wi-Fi dead zones or verifying coverage in specific areas.

# ===== Advanced Settings =====
# Log levels: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical
